            I love People, Programming, and learning new things. Currently
            looking for a place that has all three. I have dedicated my time and
            effort to turn my life upside down, stopped being scared of failing,
            and jumped headfirst into this amazing field. I finished over 240
            hours of professional online courses, and far more of them writing,
            reading, and understanding code, My journey continues to this day.
            The hunger for knowledge is growing as I learn more. All I need is a
            place where I can grow as a developer, and surly enough my
            contribution will come fast.
